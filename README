Note for MacOS with SIP enabled
-------------------------------
If you're using MacPorts, you may get an error with "Do you want to allow python.app to accept incoming network connections?". This is due to the MacPorts
python framework not having a valid signature. 

To overcome this, copy the file scripts/signpythonapp to an Administrator 
account, and execute the script, which should attach a self-generated signature to the MacPorts python framework and allow you to proceed without requiring an 
Administrator password.
