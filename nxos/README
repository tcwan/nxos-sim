1. Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NxOS is an open source operating system that runs on the Lego Mindstorms
NXT platform. It aims at providing a comprehensive base system that
provides easy-to-use APIs to the NXT's hardware, including sensors,
display and motors.

It also contains some libraries that developers of /application kernels/
may find of some interest, such as a file system or a GUI builder.

NxOS is written in C, and must be cross-compiled to the ARM platform.
See section 2 below for the building requirements.


2. Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The goal for NxOS is to have a cross-platform hosting (development) environment.
A basic setup would include:
  * Integrated Development Environment (Eclipse)
  * ARM Cross-Compiler Toolchain (GNU GCC)
  * Host-based GDB Server (Python-based) and Client (GDB for ARM)
  * Enhanced NXT Firmware by John Hansen from brixcc.sourceforge.net
  * Firmware Downloading Tool (NeXT Tool [GUI] or NeXTTool [CLI] from brixcc.sourceforge.net)

Building and testing NxOS requires a few software packages and
libraries. Since most of the external utilities are written in Python,
you will need a working installation of Python (www.python.org). Python
2.6.x or 2.7 (not 3.x) is recommended, especially for the Mac OSX
platform if remote debugging using GDB is desired.

On Mac OSX (and Windows?), the following packages are needed:
  * LEGO Mindstorms Fantom Drivers
  * Python >= 2.6 (not 3.x)
  * pyfantom
  * nxt-python >= 2.1.0

For MacOS X (>= 10.5.x) users, don't forget to install the Lego driver
Leopard update from the Lego software updates page, or you won't be able
to communicate with the brick via USB.

On Linux platforms, the following packages are needed:
  * Python >= 2.4 (not 3.x)
  * libusb
  * python-pyusb
  * PyBluez (if you want to upload/boot from the enhanced fw using bluetooth)
  * nxt-python >= 2.1.0

2.1 Firmware Utilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NeXT Tool (available from the brixcc website) by John Hansen is
available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux for uploading firmware and
files to the NXT. It has a GUI interface and is probably the most stable
tool for this purpose currently. A Command line version (NeXTTool) is
also available.

Alternatively, command line tools written in Python are provided with
NxOS to perform similar firmware uploading and control tasks, but is no
longer actively supported. boot_firmware is a Python script used to
upload an NxOS kernel to the brick. The PyNXT package can also be used
to write the firmware image to the Flash.

2.2 Cross-Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ARM Cross-compilation toolchain consists of the following components:
  * Binutils >= 2.20.51.x
  * GCC >= 4.5.x with Newlib >= 1.18
  * GDB >= 7.1
  
The target should be the ARM EABI target (arm-none-eabi), ELF targets
are not compliant with the ARM AAPCS standard.

It is advisable to obtain the ARM cross-compilation toolchain as a
precompiled package. For Windows, http://www.yagarto.de/ has suitable
ARM Cross-Toolchain. For Mac OSX, local MacPorts Port files have been 
created to build the required components (FIXME: Give path to Portfiles).

If you really want to build the ARM cross-compilation toolchain from
source, you can find in the scripts/ directory an automatic
fetcher/builder:

(Note: The script is not up to date and has not been tested with the
specified toolchain component versions)

  % mkdir -p ~/arm-gcc/
  % cd $_
  % ~/where/is/nxos/scripts/build-arm-toolchain.sh
  [...]

Don't forget to add ~/arm-gcc/install/bin to your PATH environment
variable.


3. Building and testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build NxOS, simply go inside the nxos/ subdirectory (the one
that contains base/, systems/, ...) and type:

  % scons appkernels=tests

To build and try another kernel, simply replace 'tests' with the name of
the application kernel you want to build. The available kernels are the
directory in systems/. You can also build several appkernels at once by
using a comma-separated list. Once scons is called with appkernel=xyz,
you only have to invoke scons without any arguments, because the options
to scons are stored in a file namend scons.options.

The kernel build process will generate the <kernel>*.elf as well as
the <kernel>*.bin and <kernel>.rxe files.

The *.elf files will be used for remote debugging using the Cross-GDB tool.

3.1 Booting *.rxe Kernels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*.rxe kernels are stored in the Flash of the NXT firmware like normal
NXT firmware files, which are then loaded and execute from RAM. To
execute the *.rxe kernels on the NXT, you have to install the enhanced
firmware from John Hansen. This gives the advantage that the NxOS-kernel
is stored like any other program on the NXT and you can still use NXT-G,
NBC without the need to reflash the firmware.  The disadvantage is, that
you will have less RAM available for your program, because the program
is started in RAM (as when you are uploading a <kernel>_samba.bin).

To load the *.rxe kernel, use either John Hansen's NeXT Tools or else
the boot_firmware tool (unmaintained) [See 3.2 on how to upload using
boot_firmware].

The *.rxe kernels loaded using NeXT Tools are executed (booted) by
selecting it from the NXT Firmware menu and started by pressing the
orange button when the menu shows "Run".

3.2 Booting *.bin Kernels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*.bin kernels replace the standard firmware entirely, and can either
execute from RAM (<kernel>_samba.bin) or Flash (<kernel>_rom.bin) The
boot_firmware tool (unmaintained) can be used to load the *.bin (as well
as *.rxe) kernels to the NXT

Connect the brick to your computer with the USB cable, and do:

% ./boot_firmware

The script will then ask you for the kernel to upload, and then upload
the *.bin firmware to the brick's RAM, ROM (flash) or *.rxe firmware to
RAM of the enhanced NXT-standard-firmware from John Hansen.

To upload using RAM (<kernel>_samba.bin) or flash (<kernel>_rom.bin) the
NXT must be in SAMBA-mode, which is achieved pressing the button in the
hole below the USB-port (using a LEGO-antenna or such).

WARNING: This step erases all the files, data and firmware on the NXT.
If you wish to use NXT-G or NBC in the future, you would need to have a
copy of the firmware and other files available for re-download later.

3.3. Debugging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Remote Debugging using GDB works best with RAM-based kernels. This is
because Dynamically generated Breakpoints can only be inserted into RAM
locations. Flash based kernels can only make use of pre-defined Manual
Breakpoints (inserted into the source code at specific places).

[FIXME: More details needed]

4. Notes and FAQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NxOS was started by David Anderson (http://www.natulte.net) and other
collaborators in 2007. It is a ground-up development of a reusable OS
base for the Mindstorm NXT platform. There are some architectural
similarilties to LeJOS but most of the drivers have been rewritten.

Currently NxOS only has the base layer (hardware initialization,
interrupt handlers, and drivers). There is no scheduler provided so all
programs execute in bare-metal mode using a hand-crafted event loop.

Debugging support is provided via a GDB stub implemented in the
firmware. Communications is over USB, there is no need for any
additional hardware (JTAG) debugging equipment. The only caveat is that
Interrupt code cannot be stepped through safely, since the debugger uses
Undefined Instructions to trigger itself, and uses the NxOS USB drivers to
communicate with the PC Host. 

(Note: stepping and setting breakpoints is now working since BETA 3, and
has rudimentary support for Eclipse Indigo CDT-based remote debugging).
